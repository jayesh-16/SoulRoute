   - `unclaimTicket()` - Allow counselors to unclaim tickets
   - `closeTicket()` - Allow counselors/admins to close tickets
   - `sendMessage()` - Send messages related to tickets

## How to Deploy

- All database operations use Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access tickets they are associated with
- Messages are protected and only visible to ticket participants
- Proper authentication checks in all server actions
