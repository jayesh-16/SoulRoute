# Ticket System Enhancements

This document describes the enhancements made to the ticket system for the mental health platform.

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive set of features to improve the ticket system functionality, including:

- Enhanced ticket management (claim, unclaim, close tickets)
- Integrated chat system for communication between students and counselors
- Session scheduling with Google Meet integration
- Improved UI/UX with better status tracking

## Files Created/Modified

### Database Files

1. `database/ticket_system_with_chat.sql` - New database schema with chat functionality
2. `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` - Visual representation of the database structure

### Application Files

1. `lib/actions/tickets.ts` - Updated server actions with new functionality
2. `app/tickets/page.tsx` - Enhanced UI with chat modal and additional actions

### Documentation

1. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical summary of all enhancements
2. `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
3. `README_TICKET_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - This file

## Key Features

### 1. Ticket Management

- **Claim Tickets**: Counselors can claim open tickets
- **Unclaim Tickets**: Counselors can release claimed tickets back to the pool
- **Close Tickets**: Counselors and admins can mark tickets as closed
- **Schedule Sessions**: Counselors can schedule sessions with Google Meet links

### 2. Chat System

- **Ticket-specific Chat**: Dedicated messaging for each ticket
- **Secure Communication**: Only ticket participants can view/send messages
- **Real-time Updates**: Messages are stored and retrieved from database

### 3. Enhanced UI/UX

- **Chat Modal**: Dedicated interface for ticket communication
- **Status Badges**: Visual indicators for ticket status
- **Contextual Actions**: Role-based buttons based on ticket status
- **Google Meet Integration**: Automatic meeting link generation

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The new schema includes:

- `support_tickets` table with enhanced status tracking
- `ticket_messages` table for chat functionality
- Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

### Server Actions

New functions added:

- `unclaimTicket()` - Release a claimed ticket
- `closeTicket()` - Mark a ticket as closed
- `sendMessage()` - Send messages for a ticket
- `getTicketMessages()` - Retrieve messages for a ticket

### Frontend Components

- **TicketCard**: Enhanced with new action buttons
- **ChatModal**: New component for ticket communication
- **CreateTicketForm**: Updated form validation

## Deployment Instructions

1. Apply the database schema (`database/ticket_system_with_chat.sql`)
2. Update the server actions file (`lib/actions/tickets.ts`)
3. Replace the ticket page (`app/tickets/page.tsx`)
4. Test functionality with different user roles

## Security Considerations

- All database operations use Row Level Security
- Users can only access data they're authorized to view
- Messages are isolated to specific tickets
- Proper input validation on both client and server

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time message updates using Supabase Realtime
- File attachments in ticket messages
- Ticket assignment suggestions based on counselor expertise
- Analytics dashboard for ticket metrics
- Email/SMS notifications for ticket updates
